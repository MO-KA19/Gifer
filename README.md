# Gifer
Gifer is a user-friendly GIFs generator site built on the API of giphy.com  The site offers several options and categories for animation. The user can choose the category he likes, or he can search for the thing he wants.  Specifically, then the animation he requested will be generated in the number that he requested, and the site allows the user to download the generated animation.  Or just copy its link to deal with it later, the site offers a random generator section, which is random animations that are generated when you click on  Play button Sorry for each picture. The site is designed and programmed entirely by me using HTML CSS JS, and it is a personal project that is not affiliated with any organization or  A company or a person, but only to display my skills in the api and the site is fully responsive to mobile screens. I hope you like it.
